    <h1>Updating Table</h1>
    <div id="currency-pairs-table"></div>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>All the source files I modified are located in the <code>/es6</code> folder. I also added a webpack plugin to handle generators transpilation and a <code>.babelrc</code> file used for unit tests.</p>
    <h3>High-level description</h3>
    <p>I've been told during the first interview that the teams in DB may use reactive programming, but I quickly figured out it would take me too much time and be too complex to implement some Rx-like functions (functors?) as well as my lack of experience using it would have added more head-over.</p>
    <p>As I've been very influenced by the use of React, redux and elm, I think I naturally got to some similar-ish architecture.</p>
    <p>So you'll find the following modules in this app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>state.js</code> handling the state of the app and how to update it,</li>
      <li><code>view.js</code> handling rendering after each state update,</li>
      <li><code>cmd.js</code> describes the possible messages types modifying the app state </li>
      <li><code>index.js</code> will simply connect the stomp subscription to the state and view updates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While trying to use as much pure functions as possible, I figured out I could actually use a generator to handle the state object folding, hence the implementation you might see in the <code>utils.js</code> module.</p>
    <p>The drawback of such architecture is that without some kind of virtual dom implementation the view rendering is a bit brute-force. The rendering of rows is triggered for each state update. I haven't implemented any dom-friendly rendering algorithm so far.</p>
    <h3>Error handling</h3>
    <p>I must admit I haven't taken the time to handle any resilience for this application, mostly for time gain and also because it would have added complexity.</p>
    <p>In any case I think this kind of optimisation might come later in the development of any app so that errors can be spotted earlier.</p>
    <h3>Tests</h3>
    <p>The tests do not cover everything, especially e2e tests or even BDD ones, equally for timing reasons.</p>
    <p>I mainly used some unit tests on functions that I thought where a bit more complex to implement and where I could simplify a bit the code afterwards without changing the whole implementation.</p>
    <p>You can use <code>npm test</code> to run the tests.</p>
    <h3>Code style</h3>
    <p>I haven't used any code-style checker so far (seems airbnb's one is present in the webpack conf though), as for such project I rely on the babel parser and unit tests for any typo.</p>
    <p>Needless to say I'm still happy to follow any team standards.</p>
    <h3>Suggested improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>virtual dom or any dom reconciliation library (react <i>et al.</i>)</li>
      <li>typing decoration (flow or ts)</li>
      <li>more tests, wether it is e2e and cross browser/platform, or unit ones</li>
      <li>obviously UI, because the design is fairly naive, responsiveness nonexistent, and the rows updates are a bit rough</li>
    </ul>
